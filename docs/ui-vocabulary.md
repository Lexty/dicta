# The menu-bar vocabulary shared by acta and dicta

**This file is a COPY.** The two projects are separate repositories with no shared package, so
nothing mechanical keeps them in step — that is precisely why the vocabulary is written down instead
of being left implicit in each app's SwiftUI. The check is a human reading both copies; the cost of
not having it is two menus in one menu bar that differ by twenty points and read as a mistake rather
than as a choice.

Its executable form in dicta is `Sources/DictaCore/Presentation.swift` and
`Sources/DictaCore/MenuModel.swift`, which are pure values the test runner drives. **When this file
and those disagree, they are what ships and this is what is wrong** — correct the document. In acta
the same decisions live in `Sources/Acta/ActaApp.swift`, where they are three parallel switches
rather than one value; collapsing them is proposed in `docs/ui-proposal.md` §7 and belongs to acta.

## The elements

| element | rule |
|---|---|
| container | `MenuBarExtra`, `.menuBarExtraStyle(.window)`, `LSUIElement`, no dock icon |
| panel | `.frame(width: 300)`, `.padding(12)`, `VStack(spacing: 10)`, `Divider()` between sections |
| header | tinted SF Symbol + app name `.headline` + one-line status `.caption`/`.secondary`, trailing monospaced timer while active |
| banner | icon + `.caption` text on `tint.opacity(0.12)` in a `RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 6)`, with an optional trailing `xmark` that dismisses it |
| colours | red = broken now, or the microphone is open; amber = landed but degraded, or working; green = it worked; faint = nothing there |
| primary action | `.borderedProminent`, `.controlSize(.large)`, full-width, tinted red when it is a stop |
| list | `.caption`/`.secondary` section title, at most five rows, each a 7 pt status `Circle` + a one-line primary + `.caption2`/`.secondary` secondary + a trailing borderless icon button; an empty list says so in `.caption`/`.tertiary` |
| footer | `HStack` at `.caption`: a verb on the left, `Spacer`, an exit verb on the right |
| first frame | the view model seeds its state **synchronously** in `init`, so the panel never opens blank. A `Task` started there has not run when SwiftUI first renders |
| lazy content | **`MenuBarExtra` builds its content view only when the item is clicked.** Anything that must run at launch cannot hang off the panel. Both apps hit this and solved it differently — acta with an `NSApplicationDelegateAdaptor` (`applicationDidFinishLaunching`), dicta by putting the subscription on the menu-bar **label**, which is the one view that always exists |

Two rows are **not adopted by dicta and are not divergences to fix**: the `settings`
`DisclosureGroup` (`Label("Settings", systemImage: "gearshape").font(.caption)` — acta has archive
path, segment length and a checkbox in it) is Tier 2 and waits for the external filter, since a
settings panel with one row in it is worse than none; and the `DEV` tag beside the glyph, with the
revision under the app name in `.caption2`/`.tertiary`, belongs to an app launched by hand, while
dicta's menu is a LaunchAgent with exactly one installed copy.

**Every row above was checked against `Sources/Acta/ActaApp.swift` and `ControlViewModel.swift` on
`socket-transport` on 2026-08-24, not copied from `docs/ui-proposal.md`.** That check paid for
itself immediately: dicta had shipped its primary action without `.controlSize(.large)`, which is
precisely the drift this file exists to catch and which a proposal written before either app could
not have caught.

## The two conventions

Neither is code. Both are rules about what may exist at all, and both were learned from something
already built.

**A control that cannot do what it says must not exist.** This is why the footers differ. acta has
`Quit`, because quitting acta quits it. dicta has no `Quit`: the daemon's LaunchAgent has `KeepAlive`
and launchd would restart it within ten seconds, so the button would be a lie told once per click.
dicta's right-hand footer verb is `Restart` (`launchctl kickstart -k`), which is honest and is also
the thing you want immediately after `--fetch-models`.

The same rule is what makes dicta's Stop and Abort **absent** when idle rather than greyed out. A
disabled `Stop` invites the question "why is the Start next to it disabled too", and the answer is
that there is no Start and cannot be one — a click carries no session to aim at (D30).

**Every app in the family owns one glyph and keeps it.** acta keeps `waveform`; dicta takes the
`mic` family. Two items in one menu bar must be distinguishable **by shape, not by position**,
because position is whatever the user's other menu items make it. Observed together on 2026-08-23
and they are distinguishable at a glance, which is the only test this rule has.

## Deliberate divergences

Written down so they are not later "fixed" into inconsistency.

| | acta | dicta | why |
|---|---|---|---|
| glyph | `waveform` | `mic` family | two items in one menu bar must be distinguishable by shape |
| menu-bar item | glyph alone | glyph **plus a running clock** while the microphone is open | measured: a glyph that changes only its fill is not legible without being looked at, and macOS's own microphone indicator says "some app", not "dicta" (SPEC.md F9). The clock changes the item's width, which is the change peripheral vision reads |
| primary action | symmetric Start/Stop | **Stop and Abort only** | a click has no session to aim at (D4, D22, D30) |
| footer right | `Quit` | `Restart` | launchd `KeepAlive` makes a Quit button a lie |
| footer left | one verb | `Open Record` and `Set Up…` | the setup window opens by itself only at the first snapshot of a launch, so it needs a door that is always there (D27) |
| degraded screen | `UnsupportedContent` at 240 pt for macOS 14 | none | dicta needs no capture-era availability gate |
| history rows | open in Finder | copy to clipboard | dicta's artefact is text, and the UI never injects (D28) |
| a row with nothing delivered | — | shows what was HEARD, in italic, and has **no copy button at all** | D28's structural half: the clipboard is loaded from `final` and never from `recognised`, so a row that produced no `final` has nothing for a button to carry |
| row primary line | `.caption` (a folder name) | `.callout` (a sentence of dictated speech) | the row's content is what has to be read, not merely recognised — a dictation you are trying to find again is prose, and a folder name is a label |
| dismissible banners | yes — the recovery notice carries an `xmark`, and two banners can be up at once | none, and only ever one | every banner dicta can raise is a CURRENT condition — no daemon, no models, no microphone — so dismissing one would hide something still true and it would come straight back. acta's recovery notice is about something that already happened, which is dismissible in a way a live fault is not |
| a control that is busy | present and **disabled** — `Starting…`, `Saving…` | absent | not a contradiction of the convention below: acta's disabled button is a *state display* occupying the place its control will return to, while dicta has no idle-state control to grey out in the first place |
| where the state comes from | the app **is** the daemon | a `watch` stream from a separate daemon | dicta's UI is a second client of the control socket and the daemon holds no reference to it (D27); acta's menu has no equivalent of "the daemon is not running" because for acta that state is "the app is not running" |

## The one rule that is not about pixels

**The daemon cannot tell whether a UI is running, and nothing about a dictation depends on it**
(D27). The menu app links `DictaCore`, `DictaIPC` and `DictaRecord` plus SwiftUI — the same budget
`dictactl` has, one target wider — and it opens no microphone and loads no model. With it absent,
quit or crashed, every dictation behaves identically. That is what makes the strip a *display* of
dicta rather than a *part* of it, and it is asserted by `Scripts/linkage.sh` rather than by any test,
because it is a property of what the binary is linked against (SPEC.md §8, invariants 8 and 11).
